# Steadfast Station

Code for my senior project that is primarily an exercise in web development and also a first foray into game development!

"Steadfast Station" utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to manipulate the DOM in various ways to create a dynamic single-page experience.  The game is based on the idea of immersing users in the experience of a fictional operating system that takes cues both from operating systems of the 90s and near-future/cyberpunk aesthetics. Interactivity in the page comes through manipulatable window objects, a simple chat box system, and a terminal powered by [JQuery Terminal](https://terminal.jcubic.pl/).

"FINAL-BUILD" contains the version of the game that is most complete and live via GitHub Pages.
