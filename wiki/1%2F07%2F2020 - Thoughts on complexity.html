So I just wrote this on paper, but figure I may as well type things up too.  I've been concerned about my "hacking" mechanic being complex and new and awesome, but right now I think I should just focus on it being <i class="wikidpad">something</i>.  That part is not the point of the project.  I can put more focus on the narrative themeing and accessibility of it being on the web, as well as the branching narrative and dialogue systems.  Not so much focus on the mechanic as what I do with it.<br class="wikidpad" />

But the mechanic does have to exist and be passable at least.  I don't want it to be a slog and completely turn off players to the game as a whole, but I don't think I need to spend a ton of time making it the most revolutionary thing.  Just get something down and start sketching out interactions!    </body>
