The Technician grunted at his ships's slight rumble as Steadfast Stations's docking clamps latched onto it.  It always did this, but he couldn't seem to get used to it...  The creaks and groans of the station itself subtly shifting outside certainly didn't help.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
No matter.  He would simply ignore the sounds, like he always did.  He didn't always do it successfully, but he certainly tried his best.  Music helped, if he could get it to work.  He pushed his pilot seat back into working position and pulled out his computing device, ready to interface with the station.  The call had come only hours before, requesting his immediate investigation into the seemingly malfunctioning station.  From what he had seen flying it, the station appeared to be functional judging by its exterior, but the overseers and on Etheras said they had lost all communication with the station as of the day before.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The computing device booted and the Technician opened his terminal application immediately.  <i class="wikidpad">access local station</i>, he typed.  <b class="wikidpad">provide authenticationo</b>, the terminal printed back.  Well, at least he was getting some kind of response from the thing.  But... what was his authentication again?  He clicked on the document labelled REMINDER and read the note he had written to himself so long ago.  "Your code is 1489240... again.  Have fun out there."<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<i class="wikidpad">I'll certainly try</i>, he thought to himself, entering the code into the terminal.  It went through its usual connection processes, printing several lines displaying the process before finally giving the success message: <b class="wikidpad">Connected to station, ID: STDFST</b>.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
All right then, time to get cracking.  He opened the AI COMMS module and entered CMD &gt; Status Report.  He saw the thinking icon appear, bouncing for a moment before turning into the written message from the stationo AI: "All systems functional, Technician.  May I assist you otherwise?"<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<i class="wikidpad">Well that certainly isn't true is it?</i> he thought to himself.  He glanced at the Network indicator, noting its dull color, which indicated that it did not have the access that should have been granted by connecting to the station locally.  He was cut off, it seemed, from anyone else out there.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
ASK &gt; Why was I assigned to this station?<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
"I'm not sure, Technician.  They did not tell even tell me you were coming."<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
A conversation going nowhere fast, clearly.  Perhaps the station logs told a different story?  Back to the terminal he went, typing <i class="wikidpad"></i><br class="wikidpad" />
