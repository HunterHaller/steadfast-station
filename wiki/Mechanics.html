Steadfast Station runs primarily on two pillars of gameplay:<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h76" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Dialogue</h3>
The dialogue system is presented as a text chat interface in the bottom right corner of the screen.  It allows the player to converse with the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Steadfast%20AI.html" class="wikidpad">Steadfast AI</a></span> via pre-written options.  The player can use this to learn more information about the situation as well as potentially influence its viewpoint on the world and the current situation.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<a name=".h432" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Hacking</h3>
Hacking is the process by which the player accesses the station's databases and systems.  Certain files of information can be deleted or implanted in different spaces to influence the AI's viewpoint (literally changing what information it does and does not know about).  The player can choose to implant or destroy information.  Different routes become available through this action.  Will you choose to add information about humanity's successful efforts to contain black hole anomalies to inspire the AI's confidence, or delete the AI's knowledge of past human failures to do the same (though dumbing the AI, an ethically questionable move)?<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Perhaps one could even delete enough chunks of the AI's systems that is loses all sentience and behaves at beck and call, doing as you say immediately.  The mission would be accomplished, but the AI which had some personality would be effectively dead (and it would be your fault).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
(Several simple instructional documents on the player's computer side of things would explain how these things would be possible, as well an optional tutorial sequence if the player wants to go through it, if time permits.    </body>
