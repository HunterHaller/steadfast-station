Goodness, has it already been 5 days since I made the first notes on this?  Man time flies when you aren't doing anything.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
So the mechanic remains as formless now as it was then, yay!  Isn't it all grand?  I just love the way I work through things!<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Well it's currently 3:17pm on this fine Thursday, and I have GOT to come up with something today, if only to put myself at ease.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Remember why you need to do this!<br class="wikidpad" />
<ul class="wikidpad bulletlist">
<li class="wikidpad" />Mental peace
<li class="wikidpad" />Actually getting the idea approved and passing into Capstone II
<li class="wikidpad" />Feeling personally ready to start working on the project and not lost<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
This can be a fun process, why does it have to be so stressful?!  Why can't it be easy?!  Agh, I keep getting distracted from it... Even this is a weird kind of procrastination perhaps.  Isn't it supposed to be fun to create things?  I wish it felt more like a passion project, but it really isn't.  It is being made under the enforcement of my education, it is a process that is pressed upon me, so it feels passionless.  I am going through this because I was told to, not out of my own desire to make this thing.  It fits the bill, checks the boxes I think it should check, so I'm going with it, but it still doesn't quite feel natural.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
ANYWAY... I have to come up with stuff regardless.  Matt is waiting on me, and if he doesn't see something promising he may still shut me out of CS2, and that may be the worst-case scenario.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
I have some kind of framework here, but it still feels formless to some degree...<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The hacking bit is the part I'm mainly hung up on, but it may not be too important...?  Like it doesn't have to be amazing, even though I would like for it to be.  It really is just a bridge to the rest of the game, there is so much more... With how things are, is the fun more from the aesthetic experience and story than from the gameplay itself?  I think there's enough evidence to suggest that that can be an acceptable way to make a game, at least for the right audience.  It needs to be technically and aesthetically accomplished, but also needs to be... beyond just good, going into the space of perhaps being meaningful?  I have some answer to that, but not sure it will track well.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
HOWEVER, there is something to be said for the fact that I can't get to perfectionist with this.  At some point, I really do just need to put down something.  I can put down the whole hope/despair/humanism thing as my expanded motivation (because that is honestly something I find compelling in many stories I enjoy and would love to convey it here.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
And oh, imagine if I could have most of it knocked out after today?!  Like if I could do most of it today for real, maybe polish over the next day or two and get it sent in, and then I just call it good and more or less coast into the start of the semester... ah, that would be good.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Of course, I'll need to upkeep the actual development process throughout the semester alongside the homework of my other courses (which may in turn inform the development of the project).  I also want to keep going on other personal development, beefing up on general web dev skills, reading my books on the subject, and gearing up for getting a job.  I will really need to work hard to show results in the future!  I am capable, I just have to make it work!<br class="wikidpad" />
<hr class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Ok, mechanics brainstorming, hrmm... I may actually just transfer to paper for this part of the process.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Ah, this guy is talking about combining genres...  Can I think about mine as this?  My game could be a weird combination of like text adventure plus... something else, in a way.<br class="wikidpad" />
