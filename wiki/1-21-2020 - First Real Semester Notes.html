Ok, so things are officially in motion!  Frankly I'm sitting down and starting this far too late, I should've started the first Monday of the semester (1/13) but better late than never I guess.  I just really need to start thinking about things and get moving here.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
I told Schaal that my first check in (come week 3, 1/27), I would have story outlines and a "functional wireframe" to show off.  This means that within the next ~6 days, I should have at least some paths mapped out for players to flow through the game with, plenty of dialogue written out, choice mechanics nailed down conceptually at least, AND a functioning OS style interface (even if its ugly).  I have ideas on how to implement some of these, but they will all take time (something I feel like I have precious little of.  How much time do I have actually...?<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
I have tonight, work time tomorrow (4 hrs), perhaps some of tomorrow night post-movie, Thursday work time (3 hrs) and night, Friday morning/afternoon, Saturday morning/afternoon, and Sunday evening.  That's a fair bit of time as long as I'm focused up.  I really can't afford to lose focus this time.  Like yes, take SOME time for relaxation, but also...   I'm sure all I need is within reach if I push hard enough.  I will do what I can.  I have 69 days from now until the project is due, plus keeping up with other homework along the way.  Stay focused and you can do it, don't procrastinate excessively!<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">Anyway</b>, what was I talking about?<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
To work towards check-in in a week (and the 7 minute presentation on Feb 10, week 5!), I want to try coding out functions in the play space, get things feeling right there (I have some ideas on making that work, but it'll all take experimentation of course.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Just had a thought... How much of the game's mechanics do I want to really be a part of the world?  I thought of a way to do it via the chat, but what about other things?  Should the replayable nature of it come into play at all?  Do it like Reigns, where it is designed for you to go in over and over and evolve over time?  A Groundhog day situation, almost like a ROGUELIKE, where you don't have all the pieces to solve the real issue the first time?  <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Holy shit.  Did I just stumble on the ultimate form of this?  Is this a fucking roguelike text adventure?!  What a catchy genre sound... Oh man, because then you would be compelled by more than just curiosity to plow through the multiple ways to play the game, becoming armed with new information, some trial and error, where even failures yield important results.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Time play would have to be essential then for this to really make sense.  Roguelikes tend to build their replayability into the story/mechanics unless they're very arcady.  But not this one... This would need to have purpose.  Does the black hole cause time distortions?  And they're triggered by something that happens towards the end, except when you've got everything lined up, it doesn't...  <b class="wikidpad">I need an explanation for this.</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
(There's some <i class="wikidpad">Outer Wilds</i> bullshit going on here actually...)<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Perhaps... something happened with the black hole causing regularly spaced time distortions that send certain things back like 15 minutes (to the start of things).  You have quantum computing so your notes and info can remain the same, letting your knowledge persist between sessions, but the AI does not?  It must have to reset, but you can mess with it in different ways to get different information out of it and such to learn how to escape this...<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
This is a really fun idea... but is rather ambitious.  Perhaps too much so.  I may still be able to keep it in some form, but need to be toned down probably.  I really need to figure that out though!  It's kind of important for figuring out the actual mechanics and how things work and shit!  Perhaps save the time manipulation for like, the sequel...<br class="wikidpad" />

<br class="wikidpad" />
<b class="wikidpad">What is the conflict?</b><br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
The thought so far has been some kind of disturbance from a black hole threatens a nearby <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="World%20Stations.html" class="wikidpad">Wolrd Station</a></span> (<span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Etheras.html" class="wikidpad">Etheras</a></span>), and the AI set to watch it has decided not to warn the humans for various reasons.<br class="wikidpad" />
