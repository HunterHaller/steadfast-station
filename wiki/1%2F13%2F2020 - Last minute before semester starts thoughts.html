So it's the end of the last day of break, 1:42am currently, and thought about adding more to my document I sent to Matt to add more context, but now feeling like it might not be worth it (and also just tired and out of focus and like I wouldn't have anything intelligent to say).  Should I still add things?  Is it worth the effort? <br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
It all feels so aimless, I don't know what is expected of me.  I do concisely get across what I feel to be the most important points in what I have written, and I think on some level they satisfy what he wanted.  At this point, is it even worth worrying about?  It's the middle of the night and I'm <i class="wikidpad">still</i> worried about it, but like... is it worth it?  What substantial changes or additions could I possibly make in this state at this time?!  If I had a clearer idea of what was wanted from me, I would add it, but things are too far gone now.  And who knows, maybe they'll disqualify me purely for the fact that I didn't turn it in sooner (at which point I would kind of argue that there was no deadline and no clear indication of when things should be in by; without structure, I am nothing.  I still got it in before school started, but not in time for him to really see it before then I guess).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Anyway, I just closed the document.  It is what it is at this point.  I offered to provide additional explanation if needed, and I do feel confident overall.  My fate is sealed not only by my actions of the past week, but of the past month.  I could have emailed Matt at any time asking for clarification on what was needed and when, but did not.  I wandered blind through my own faults.  If I fail, it is my own doing, and I will handle it as needed.  I will survive regardless, and I will bear my failures as they come.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
I do feel like my chances are fairly good though.  As felt before, I feel like standards are fairly low. I got just under the baseline score that equated to "approved pending follow-up" and I have provided follow-up with additional details.  I just have to hope the new details are enough.  I feel that they provide a tighter picture with more defined mechanics, gameplay, narrative, and purpose, but I suppose I just have to hope that he see / they see that.  Alas, it is out of my hands.<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Here's to hope and not stressing about it for now.  Onward to the dawn of the new semester.     </body>
