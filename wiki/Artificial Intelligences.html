Artificial intelligences are man-made, digital beings that exist solely on computers, in digital space.  They can exist anywhere that there is digital storage, even without a proper operating system to allow them to interface with the outside world (though they are in a somewhat dormant state at these times).<br class="wikidpad" />

<a name=".h341" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">History</h3>
AI have been around for quite some time, but their current iterations have only existed for about a century.  Developed with heavy input from the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Revulend%20Corporation.html" class="wikidpad">Revulend Corporation</a></span>, AI development took the great leap into what could be called true intelligence during this time period and became far more useful than ever before.<br class="wikidpad" />

<a name=".h673" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Sentience</h3>
All Revulend-made intelligences have full sentience and free will.  This is a factor limited by their incredibly limited capacity to influence the physical world.  Special care is taken when deciding which tasks to assign AI, as one that decides to go against its purpose and perhaps turn against humanity could prove disastrous.  Some countermeasures to prevent this have been put in place, but most AI remain largely unfiltered.<br class="wikidpad" />

<a name=".h1120" class="wikidpad"></a><h3 class="wikidpad heading-level3">Dormancy</h3>
It is possible for an AI to reach a state of dormancy in one of two ways.  Firstly, if the AI is placed onto a digital storage device with no operating system present, the AI is considered dormant.  In this state, it is as though it is paused, receiving no sensory input and unable to interact with anything, but still existing fully.  When the storage device is inserted into an operated computing device, it becomes functional once again.  AI experience this transition as though no time passes at all.<br class="wikidpad" />
