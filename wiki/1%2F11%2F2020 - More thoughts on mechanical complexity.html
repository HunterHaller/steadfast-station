So now I'm worried that the mini text adventure, extra puzzle mechanic I thought of may be completely useless and out of place.  Is the concept of conversation + simulated file manipulation all that's really necessary?  A somewhat complex web of Java Script things to keep track of variables and checks, letting the player roam free in the files and discover things for themselves, read information, try to think about what influences the AI character and what wouldn't matter.<br class="wikidpad" />

Yes... I feel that actually does make more sense.  Just include terminal-style exploration and manipulations (a la <i class="wikidpad">Hacknet</i>) and dialogue choices that also branch the narrative...<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Those bits could make up the bulk of the actual gameplay bits, and then focus more of my time on building the aesthetic and narrative experience.  Quality over quantity, try to make it just the slickest thing you've seen all day.  Probably roughly a 15-30 minute experience if that works.    </body>
