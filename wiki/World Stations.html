World Stations are enormous man-made space stations the size of small planets.  Being so large, they draw their power from black holes and the drawn objects that surround them.<br class="wikidpad" />

World stations are the <span class="wikidpad wiki-link"><a href="Revulend%20Corporation.html" class="wikidpad">Revulend Corporation</a></span>'s solution to intergalactic habitation.  With the lack of nearby planets capable of sustaining life, the Corporation decided to build their own.  The earliest trial models were much smaller and were placed near unary star systems (in traditional fashion) and ran entirely off of solar power, but these were to seen as inferior as soon as black hole powered stations were invented.  Since that advent, all world stations are placed near black holes and gather their power from them.  This always a risky position, but the Corporation (and the worlds' inhabitants) generally see the benefits as worth the chance of absolute destruction.  <br class="wikidpad" />

The primary power source for a world station is the super-energized objects that have drawn to close to a black hole.  The station is pushed into place near a black hole (which its thrusters are able to keep it away from at a safe distance).  Using extended energy collection panels, the station draws power from the superheated, glowing objects caught in the black hole's orbit.  These objects are being pulled and spun about by the black hole's supergravity such that they give off immense amounts of energy, approximately 97% of which is able to be collected by the station's panels, which collects both the energy of the heat and light of these objects.  Such immense amounts of power are collected from these many objects that the whole station is able to run off of them alone.  The collection of objects tends to resupply itself by the natural random wanderings of spaceborne objects, but can be artificially inflated if necessary.<br class="wikidpad" />
