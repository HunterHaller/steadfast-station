Matt indicated my project has been labelled "tentatively approved" after getting a quite low review score.  It needs follow-up before break ends (Jan 13 is the first day of school).<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
Primary points from the email:<ul class="wikidpad bulletlist">
<li class="wikidpad" />Prototype &gt; mockups
<li class="wikidpad" />No real substance yet
<li class="wikidpad" />Nail premise soon, integrate OS design
<li class="wikidpad" />No mechanic yet or motivation to design one.  This is needed soon!
<li class="wikidpad" />Flawed design process.  Just doing something "cool" isn't enough.  Find significance!<br class="wikidpad" />
</ul>
He ended with a request for my next steps done over break, looking for "mechanics, story, etc."<br class="wikidpad" />
<br class="wikidpad" />
I'm cutting things pretty close here, about 8 days from school starting as of today, but I'm sure I can do it if dedicated.<br class="wikidpad" />

Shoot for turning things in to Matt by, say, Wednesday?  Thursday?  Shoot for early, but no later than Friday for sure.    </body>
